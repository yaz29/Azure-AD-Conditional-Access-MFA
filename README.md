# Azure AD ‚Äì Conditional Access & MFA

## üß© Overview
This lab demonstrates how to protect cloud identities in Microsoft Azure using Conditional Access and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
The configuration ensures that only authorized users belonging to a specific security group can access cloud resources, and only after successfully completing MFA verification.  

This setup reflects a real-world implementation of Zero Trust security, enforcing identity-based access control to defend against credential compromise and unauthorized access.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Risk
Most cloud breaches originate from compromised user credentials. Attackers use techniques such as phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks to gain access to sensitive environments.  
Without strong authentication and contextual access controls, even a single leaked password can provide entry to critical systems or confidential data.  

By enforcing Conditional Access with MFA in Azure, organizations significantly reduce the risk of:  
- Unauthorized account access  
- Credential theft  
- Privilege escalation and lateral movement  

This approach aligns with Zero Trust principles verifying every access attempt before granting permissions.  

## üõ† What I Built
- Created Microsoft Entra ID users (Jasmine & Aaron) and a dedicated security group `MFA-Required-Users`.  
- Configured a Conditional Access Policy requiring MFA for all sign-ins from that group.  
- Applied  Zero Trust‚Äìaligned identity protection by enforcing contextual access.  
- Tested the full flow: login prompt ‚Üí MFA challenge ‚Üí access granted only after successful verification.  
- Documented all steps, added screenshots, and included an architecture diagram for clarity and recruiter review.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Microsoft Entra ID User Creation  
Created two cloud-only test users in Azure AD for the lab environment:  
- `Jasmine Demo`  
- `Aaron Demo`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Security Group Setup  
- Created a security group named MFA-Required-Users in Microsoft Entra ID.  
- Added Jasmine & Aaron as members of this group to target MFA enforcement.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Per-User MFA Enablement (Legacy)  
- Enabled per-user MFA for both users via the classic MFA settings in Microsoft Entra ID.  
- Verified the MFA status for each account.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional Access Policy Configuration  
1. Navigated to Microsoft Entra ID ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Conditional Access.  
2. Created a policy named Require MFA for MFA-Required-Users.  
3. Assigned the policy to the `MFA-Required-Users` group.  
4. Targeted All Cloud Apps.  
5. Set the access control to Require multi-factor authentication.  
6. Disabled Security Defaults to avoid conflicts.  
7. Enabled the new policy and confirmed it was active.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ MFA Prompt Verification  
- Signed in as Jasmine to test policy enforcement.  
- Verified that an MFA registration prompt appeared before access to resources was granted.  
- Confirmed that the Conditional Access policy was actively enforcing MFA for group members.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup  
To leave the environment clean and secure:  
- Deleted test users Jasmine & Aaron.  
- Removed the MFA-Required-Users group.  
- Deleted the Conditional Access policy.  
- Disabled per-user MFA settings (if enabled).  
- Verified that no lab-related objects remained in Microsoft Entra ID or Conditional Access.  

## ‚úÖ Tools Result: 

MFA was successfully enforced via Conditional Access for all targeted users, validating the Zero Trust model implementation. 

## üß∞ Tools & Services Used
- Microsoft Azure Portal  
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- Conditional Access Policies  
- Microsoft Authenticator App  


## üí° Outcome
By implementing Azure AD Conditional Access with MFA, this lab demonstrates how to strengthen identity protection, enforce secure authentication, and reduce credential-based attack surfaces ‚Äî providing a practical foundation for enterprise-level Identity & Access Management (IAM).
